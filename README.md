# Homework # 3 - Selection and Loops
## Overview
Full Collaboration is authorized, however all work must be your own and you must understand everything submitted. Submit your code via GitHub classroom. 

## Before you Start
Ensure that you have read the lessons on [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

## Procedures
### [Structure of a Program](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/) Write the basic outline of a C++ Program 
    Write a program that prints your name (3/c Hopley Yeaton) on one line and “TOOP HW3” (without the quotation marks) on the second line.

    ````
    3/c Hopley Yeaton
    TOOP HW3
    ````

### [Variables and types](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/) Write a loop that presents the user with several options. The user should be shown the following six options:

    The first option will be to add two user specified numbers together 

    The second option will be to add three user specified numbers together 

    The third option will be to raise a user specified number to the power of another user specified number 

    The fourth option will be to double a user specified number 

    The fifth option will be the print the author’s information 

    The sixth and final option will be to exit the program 

        
### [Basic input and ouptut](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/), [Flow Control](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/control/) The program should accept user input to determine which option the user selected. 

    Read in an integer from 1-6.  

    Create either a switch statement or an if-else structure corresponding to each input option. 

    Implement options five and six directly in the switch structure. The rest of the options will call functions that we write in step four.  

    
### [Functions](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/functions/) Write several functions to fulfill the functionality listed above.

    The first function should be called sum. It will take two integers as an argument and return an integer representing the sum of the two inputs. 

    The second function will also be called sum. This function, however, will take in three arguments and return an integer representing the sum of all three inputs. 

    The third function should be called power. It will take two positive integers and return a long representing the first integer to the power of the second integer. 

    The fourth function should be called doubleNumber. It will take in one integer and will not return anything. The number that was passed into the function should be modified after the execution of that function!         (Hint: You will need to pass by reference here.) 

    
### [Functions](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/functions/) For each of the following questions, write 2-3 sentence long responses in a block comment at the top of your homework file.

    Give an explanation of the difference passing arguments by reference and passing arguments by value as well as when you would use either. 

    Give an explanation of what “overloaded” means in the context of functions. 

    Give an explanation of return types and how they might be used.
