Q- Give an explanation of the difference passing arguments by reference and passing 
arguments by value as well as when you would use either:
A- Passing by value is done if only the value is to be manipulated in a function, leaving 
the inital variable as it was. Passing by reference is often used to change multiple variables
in one part of code, and changes the specific register for the variables.

Q- Give an explanation of what “overloaded” means in the context of function:
A- Function overloading is when 2 functions have the same name but different parameters. The 
inputs into the function call will coorelate to which function is used.

Q- Give an explanation of return types and how they might be used:
A- A function can return as any usual variable type, such as int or bool. Different function
uses may require different variable type outputs.
